For that i login to smartinternz account by creating login credentials as educator.
To start my project i needed IBM acadamy account , so i filled a request form for getting acadamy account since our college does not having IBM initiative email id.
After receiving smartinternz email id and password from smart internz i created my IBM cloud account with my email koonamalla@rediff.com then started project work on 9 th october
